<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository is created with a purpose of testing different data structures in python with the main goal of creating an AI program. By analyzing the user's behaviour and vocabulary it will be able to have a meaningful conversation with the user.</p>

<h2>How the AI program works exactly?</h2>
<p>
  <list><ol><li>After the program has been started, it asks the name of the User and how the User would the AI to be called.</li> 
    <li>After the program received the answers, it separates them into two elements of a list by the function split() and tries to reach and scan stored data from a foreign text file about the User. <ol><li><b>If this procedure is commitable</b>, the program commit this action and greet the User as an old friend.</li><li><b>Else</b> the User is asked to describe themselves with a simple sentence. Then User's reply is being analyzed with a function, which separates the words of the sentence into elements of a list, and browse for each word in a Python dictionary.</ol></li></li></ol></list></p>
